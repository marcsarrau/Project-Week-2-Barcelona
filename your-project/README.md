## Project Description
The aim of this project is to depict the evolution of the motorcycle and moped park in Barcelona in the last 5 years.  

## Questions & Hypotheses
The questions of the project are:
    - Which district is the most bike-aficionado?
    - Which district has the most powerful bikes?
    - What is a "typical" accident?
        - Most dangerous year, month, day of the month, day of the week, time
        - Target victim


## Dataset
This study is based on two datasets:
    - The motorcycle park in Barcelona (Register of all the motorcycles per district, and its characteristics).
    - Traffic accidents in Barcelona.
    
https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/es/organization/seguretat

## Database
We created a new csv table out of the whole traffic data and we extracted the metrics we found the most interesting. We created a Jupyter Notebook file out of the two databases per each year. 

What is the structure of your database? Have you created more than one table and if yes, how are they related to each other? 

## Workflow
First we researched about data and we thought one of the most interesting part of transportation is safety, so we focused on the means of transport that is more dangerous: the motorcycle.

You can find it on our Trello down below.

## Organization
We organized by simply sketching some notes in paper, asking the TA, in the afternoon. We were continously debating about the direction our project could take to be the most meaningful possible and yet stick to our time constraint.

What does your repository look like?
Our file structure contained initially a directory for each member to work and then a common data folder for us to read the files. Then we eliminated the individual folders and put it altogether.
